# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 First-Stage Landing Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to predict the success of first-stage booster landings.  
The goal was to apply **data science and machine learning techniques** to explore how factors such as payload mass, launch site, and booster version influence landing outcomes, a critical factor in reducing launch costs through rocket reusability.  

By leveraging **Python, SQL, and machine learning models**, this project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics: from exploratory data analysis and interactive dashboards to predictive modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand trends in Falcon 9 launches and landings.  
- Visualize how booster version, payload, and launch site affect landing outcomes.  
- Build predictive models to classify landing success/failure.  
- Identify the most important features driving landing success.  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed **payload mass, orbit type, and launch site** distributions.  
- Identified **booster version** as the strongest predictor of landing success.  
- Built interactive dashboards (using **Plotly Dash**) to explore trends by site, payload, and outcomes.  
- Highlight: Landing success rates improved significantly with the introduction of **Block 5 boosters**.

## 🖥️ Interactive Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was developed with **Plotly Dash** to visualize:  
- Launch success by payload mass and orbit.  
- Landing outcomes across different launch sites.  
- Booster version performance and reusability.

## 🤖 Machine Learning & Predictive Analysis
- Built multiple classification models:
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Decision Tree**  
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- Compared model performance using **ROC-AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
- **Best Model**: SVM, chosen for its strong ROC-AUC and flexibility in threshold tuning to balance false positives and false negatives.  

📌 *Key Finding*:  
> Booster version emerged as the most critical predictor of landing success, followed by payload mass and launch site.

🚀 Results
Booster version is the primary driver of landing success.
Payload mass has a nonlinear relationship with success — heavier payloads reduce landing probability.
Launch site also plays a role, with some sites showing higher success rates.
The SVM model provided the best predictive performance.
📌 Practical Impact: These insights align with SpaceX’s real-world improvements in reusability and cost reduction.

🌟 Key Learnings
Real-world data requires extensive cleaning and transformation.
Interactive dashboards enhance data storytelling.
Model evaluation beyond accuracy (ROC-AUC, F1-score) is critical for imbalanced datasets.
Domain knowledge (rocket design, booster versions) matters when interpreting ML results.
